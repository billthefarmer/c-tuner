## Using

Play your instrument into your microphone and observe the
display. The slider at the top left adjusts the microphone input
level, the oscilloscope display at the top shows the input
waveform. The display below shows the spectrum of the input. It
may be zoomed in and out by clicking on the pane. When zoomed in
the display shows about Â±50 cents around the current note and
includes all concurrent notes within that range.

## Building

Use the simple makefile provided. The convoluted GNU autoconfig/automake system appears to work, but overwrites the makefile with one that doesn't work. There is a backup in `Makefile.de`.

### Raspberry Pi

The app builds ok on a pi, but will not work because of the lack of an audio input. It should work fine with one - untested.
